- Three.js local copy stable
- All major systems operational
- No active bugs or issues

## Session Summary - Submarine Movement Realism Enhancement
**Progress: 100%** - TASK COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

### Problem Addressed
User requested submarine movement to feel more like submarines and less like aircraft:
- Reduce yaw and pitch rates for more realistic turning
- Reduce acceleration rates for more submarine-like response
- Mouse wheel should set throttle target, with gradual speed changes instead of instant

### Changes Made
1. **Reduced turning rates** for submarine-like movement:
   - `baseTurnRate`: 0.03 → 0.008 (73% slower)
   - `turnRate`: 0.02 → 0.005 (75% slower)
   - `pitchRate`: 0.015 → 0.004 (73% slower)
   - `rollRate`: 0.01 → 0.003 (70% slower)

2. **Implemented gradual acceleration/deceleration system**:
   - Added `targetSpeed` property (set by mouse wheel)
   - Added `accelerationRate: 0.8` for realistic speed changes
   - Created `updateSpeedControl()` method for smooth speed transitions
   - `thrustRate`: 2.0 → 0.3 (85% slower acceleration)

3. **Enhanced throttle system**:
   - Mouse wheel now sets target speed instead of instant speed
   - Actual speed gradually approaches target speed
   - Updated HUD display to show both throttle setting and current speed

### Technical Implementation Details
- **submarine.js:22**: Reduced `baseTurnRate` from 0.03 to 0.008
- **submarine.js:68-71**: Reduced all direct control rates significantly
- **submarine.js:75-76**: Added `targetSpeed` and `accelerationRate` properties
- **submarine.js:533**: Modified `handleWheel()` to set target speed
- **submarine.js:540**: Added `updateSpeedControl()` call in main update loop
- **submarine.js:670-683**: Created new `updateSpeedControl()` method
- **submarine.js:898-900**: Updated throttle display to show both target and current speed

### Verification Status
- ✅ **Turning rates**: Dramatically reduced for submarine-like handling
- ✅ **Acceleration system**: Now gradual instead of instant
- ✅ **Mouse wheel throttle**: Sets target speed, actual speed follows gradually
- ✅ **HUD display**: Shows both throttle setting and current speed
- ✅ **Server running**: Available on localhost:8000 for testing

## Result
Submarine movement now feels much more realistic with:
- Slow, deliberate turning like real submarines
- Gradual acceleration and deceleration
- Throttle control that sets target speed with realistic response time
- Enhanced realism while maintaining playability

## Available Next Steps
1. **Fine-tune movement rates** - Adjust based on user feedback
2. **Visual Polish** - Enhanced submarine colors, lighting effects
3. **Mission System** - Objectives, scoring, progression mechanics  
4. **Advanced AI** - Coordinated enemy formations and tactics
5. **Environmental Effects** - Weather, depth pressure, visibility
6. **Sound System** - Combat audio and submarine sound effects

## Testing Instructions
1. Navigate to http://localhost:8000
2. Use mouse wheel to set throttle - observe gradual speed changes
3. Use WASD for turning/diving - notice slower, more submarine-like response
4. Observe HUD showing both throttle setting and actual speed
