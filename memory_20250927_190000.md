# Sub War 2060 - Session Memory
**Date:** 2025-09-27
**Session:** Typhoon Class Fighter Submarine 3D Model Creation
**Time:** 19:00:00

## 🎯 **TASK:**
Analyze three-view technical diagram and generate Three.js code for angular Typhoon class fighter submarine

## 📋 **USER SPECIFICATIONS:**
- Angular, diamond-shaped hull (NOT cylindrical)
- Fighter submarine design (sleek, space-fighter aesthetic)
- Dual nacelles/pods visible in top view
- Triangular nose profile from front view
- Swept-back angular design from side view
- Uses triangular and angular shapes, NOT cones or cylinders
- Should have faceted surfaces rather than smooth curves

## 🔍 **ANALYSIS FROM EXISTING CODE:**
- Current createTyphoonClass() uses cylindrical geometries (CylinderGeometry, ConeGeometry)
- Located at lines 2036-2166 in submarine.js
- Function returns THREE.Group() with meshes for each component
- Uses OBJ loading with procedural fallback
- Needs complete replacement of procedural geometry section

## 📝 **SESSION ACTIVITIES:**
- 19:00:00 - Read latest session memory
- 19:00:00 - Examined existing createTyphoonClass function structure
- 19:00:00 - User provided analysis of three-view technical diagram
- 19:05:00 - **COMPLETED:** Complete rewrite of createTyphoonClass function

## ✅ **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED:**
1. ✅ **Diamond Hull**: Rotated BoxGeometry (45°) for angular diamond cross-section
2. ✅ **Triangular Nose**: 4-sided ConeGeometry for sharp angular nose profile
3. ✅ **Dual Nacelles**: Angular pods with 30° cant and outward angle positioning
4. ✅ **Wing Struts**: Angular connection beams between hull and nacelles
5. ✅ **Swept Fins**: Upper/lower stabilizers with swept-back angular design
6. ✅ **Engine Outlets**: Angular exhaust ports on nacelle rear sections
7. ✅ **Sensor Array**: Faceted top-mounted sensor pod with stealth angle
8. ✅ **Armor Plates**: Angular hull reinforcement matching diamond profile
9. ✅ **Torpedo Tubes**: Four angular weapon ports in forward section

## 🎯 **KEY FEATURES IMPLEMENTED:**
- **NO CYLINDRICAL SHAPES**: All curved geometries replaced with angular equivalents
- **FACETED SURFACES**: BoxGeometry creates sharp-edged faceted appearance
- **DUAL NACELLE DESIGN**: Side-mounted angular pods as specified
- **FIGHTER AESTHETICS**: Sharp angles, swept surfaces, military appearance
- **THREE.js INTEGRATION**: Maintains existing function signature and Group structure

## 📊 **PROGRESS:** 100% - Task Complete
