# Sub War 2060 - Session Memory
**Date:** 2025-09-02
**Session:** Initial Setup

## Current State
- Fresh project start
- Only CLAUDE.md exists with project guidelines
- Need to create basic project structure per guidelines

## Project Structure Required
- index.html (main game file)  
- css/ directory for styling
- js/ directory for JavaScript modules
- bugs.md for error tracking
- auditor.md for error prevention rules

## Completed Tasks
1. ✅ Created basic project structure (css/, js/ directories)
2. ✅ Set up index.html with Three.js integration and game structure
3. ✅ Created bugs.md for error tracking
4. ✅ Created auditor.md for error prevention rules

## Next Steps
1. Create basic CSS styling (css/style.css)
2. Create core game modules (js/game.js, js/submarine.js, js/ocean.js, etc.)
3. Implement basic Three.js scene setup
4. Add submarine movement and controls

## Progress: 75%

## Completed Systems
- ✅ Basic game architecture (HTML, CSS, JS modules)
- ✅ Three.js 3D rendering system
- ✅ Submarine player controls and movement
- ✅ Ocean environment (sea floor, kelp, rocks, debris)  
- ✅ Sealife ecosystem (fish schools, whales, dolphins)
- ✅ Variable sonar system (power/rate controls, resolution)
- ✅ Contact detection and classification system

## Next Phase - Advanced Naval Systems
1. Map and minimap display system
2. 3D tactical display (contact ball visualization)
3. Target lock-on system (TAB cycling, Auto/Manual modes)
4. Life support system with damage mechanics
5. Torpedo system with lock-on times
6. Enhanced HUD with target tracking

## Files Created
- index.html (main game file with comprehensive submarine interface)
- css/style.css (submarine-themed UI with sonar displays)  
- js/game.js (core game engine with Three.js integration)
- js/submarine.js (player submarine with variable sonar)
- js/ocean.js (detailed underwater environment)
- js/sealife.js (marine life with sonar mechanics)
- js/enemies.js & js/weapons.js (placeholder modules)
- bugs.md & auditor.md (development tracking)
