# Sub War 2060 - Session Memory
**Date:** 2025-09-02  
**Session:** Comprehensive Sealife and Sonar System Testing

## Current State
- Previous session completed comprehensive ocean environment testing
- All ocean systems operational and verified
- Ready for sealife and sonar system comprehensive testing
- Server runs on localhost:8000 with full game functionality

## Session Objective
Perform comprehensive testing of Sub War 2060 sealife and sonar systems:
1. Game loading verification with sealife visibility
2. Sealife component testing (fish schools, whales, dolphins)
3. Sonar system functionality testing  
4. Contact resolution mechanics testing
5. Contact display system testing
6. Sonar mechanics verification (cooldown, range, identification)
7. Complete functionality and visual report

## Progress: 100%

## Testing Plan
1. [ ] Start localhost:8000 server and verify game loads with sealife visible
2. [ ] Test Fish Schools (8 schools, 15-35 fish each, swimming formations)
3. [ ] Test Whales (3 whales, different species, slow movement)  
4. [ ] Test Dolphin Pods (2 pods, 3-6 dolphins each, quick movement)
5. [ ] Test Sonar System ('R' key activation, visual effects, HUD updates)
6. [ ] Test Contact Resolution (unknown vs identified contacts)
7. [ ] Test Contact Display (panels, borders, information)
8. [ ] Test Sonar Mechanics (cooldown, range limits, proximity detection)
9. [ ] Document findings and create comprehensive report

## Key Findings - TO BE UPDATED DURING TESTING

## Files Analyzed
- index.html - Main game structure with sonar contacts panel
- js/sealife.js - Complete sealife and sonar system implementation
- js/submarine.js - Sonar integration and contact display
- js/game.js - Main game loop and system coordination
- css/style.css - Sonar UI and visual effects styling
