# Bug Pattern Analysis and Auditor Enhancement

Systematically analyze the project's bug tracking and auditor systems to improve error prevention and detection capabilities.

## Analysis Scope
Depth level: $ARGUMENTS (default: detailed)

### Phase 1: Bug Pattern Analysis
- Read and analyze bugs.md for recurring error patterns
- Identify root causes and failure modes
- Categorize bugs by severity, frequency, and impact
- Extract actionable insights for prevention

### Phase 2: Auditor System Review
- Examine auditor.md for current detection rules
- Assess effectiveness of existing prevention measures
- Identify gaps in current error detection
- Evaluate rule coverage and accuracy

### Phase 3: Pattern-Based Enhancement
- Generate new auditor rules based on bug patterns
- Enhance existing rules with learned patterns
- Create predictive models for potential issues
- Update prevention strategies and best practices

### Phase 4: Documentation Update
- Update auditor.md with enhanced detection rules
- Document new patterns and prevention strategies
- Create actionable recommendations for development
- Establish monitoring and feedback loops

This command bridges reactive bug tracking with proactive error prevention, continuously improving the project's quality assurance capabilities.
