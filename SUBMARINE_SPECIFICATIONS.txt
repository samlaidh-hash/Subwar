                              SPECIAL MECHANICS EXPLAINED
================================================================================

## MHD DRIVE SYSTEM
Description: Magnetohydrodynamic propulsion using seawater as reaction mass
- Symmetric Performance: Same max speed forward and reverse
- Symmetric Acceleration: Same acceleration rate in both directions  
- Silent Operation: No cavitation or mechanical noise
- Instant Direction Change: No need to "turn around" for reverse
- Power Requirement: High electrical power consumption

## BALLISTIC PHYSICS (Cannons)
Description: Realistic projectile velocity degradation over distance
- Initial Phase (0-90% range): Gradual velocity loss (10% total)
- Final Phase (90-100% range): Rapid exponential decay to zero
- Physics Formula: Cubic decay function in final 10%
- Effectiveness: Projectiles lose damage potential near max range
- Range Limit: Projectiles self-destruct when velocity drops below 10%

## DRAG TURN SYSTEM  
Description: Emergency high-G turning maneuver with consequences
- Activation: Double-tap A or D keys  
- Effect: 30% increase in turn rate
- Consequence: Causes hull damage (5 HP/second default)
- Risk/Reward: Better maneuverability vs. hull integrity
- Class Variation: Different damage rates based on hull strength

## SPEED-DEPENDENT TURNING
Description: Realistic physics - harder to turn at high speed
- Formula: Turn_Rate = Base_Turn_Rate * (1 - Speed_Factor * Turn_Rate_Decay)
- Effect: Turn rate decreases as speed increases
- Tactical Impact: Must balance speed vs. maneuverability
- Class Variation: Different decay factors per submarine class

## LOCK-ON SYSTEM
Description: Target acquisition system for guided weapons  
- Per-Weapon Memory: Each weapon maintains separate lock progress
- Lock Preservation: Switching weapons preserves individual lock states
- Lock Requirements: Some weapons require target lock before firing
- Lock Decay: Lock progress decays when out of range
- Sonar Dependency: Active sonar improves lock acquisition rate

## ARMOR SYSTEM
Description: Damage reduction and penetration mechanics
- Armor Value: Reduces incoming damage by fixed amount
- Penetration Threshold: Minimum damage needed to penetrate armor
- Calculation: Final_Damage = max(0, Raw_Damage - Armor)
- Threshold Check: Damage below PEN_Threshold has no effect
- System-Specific: Different armor values for different subsystems

================================================================================
                           ADVANCED DIRECTIONAL DAMAGE SYSTEM
================================================================================

## ARMOR FACING SYSTEM
Each submarine has 6 independent armor facings:
1. **FORE** (Front) - Key 1 for emergency redistribution
2. **PORT** (Left) - Key 2 for emergency redistribution  
3. **STARBOARD** (Right) - Key 3 for emergency redistribution
4. **AFT** (Rear) - Key 4 for emergency redistribution
5. **TOP** (Upper) - Key 5 for emergency redistribution
6. **BOTTOM** (Lower) - Key 6 for emergency redistribution

## ARMOR COMPOSITION (Per Facing)
### Oobleck Polymer Layer (Outer 50%)
- **Properties**: Self-healing, redistributive nano-material
- **Auto-Redistribution**: 1% of starting HP per second between facings
- **Emergency Redistribution**: Double-tap keys 1-6 to double facing armor
- **Redistribution Cost**: Extra points taken evenly from 4 adjacent facings
- **Behavior**: Flows like liquid but hardens on impact

### Meta-Material Composite Layer (Inner 50%)  
- **Properties**: Advanced crystalline structure, static armor
- **Behavior**: Does not redistribute, permanent protection
- **Failure**: Catastrophic breach when depleted allows cascade damage

## DAMAGE RESOLUTION PROCESS
### Step 1: Hit Location Determination
- Ray-casting or collision detection determines impact facing
- Projectile angle affects which facing takes damage

### Step 2: Penetration Check
- **Formula**: If Damage <= PEN_Threshold, damage only affects armor
- **PEN_Threshold**: 50% of starting Hull_Armor_HP for that facing
- **Armor Damage**: Reduce armor HP by damage amount
- **Penetration**: If Damage > PEN_Threshold, excess damage penetrates

### Step 3: Internal Damage Cascade
- **System Selection**: Hit location determines which system is struck first
- **System PEN Values**:
  - Engines: 70% of starting HP  
  - Weapons: 30% of starting HP
  - Sensors: 30% of starting HP
  - Life Support: 30% of starting HP
  - Navigation: 50% of starting HP
- **Cascade Rule**: If damage exceeds system PEN, excess continues through hull
- **Exit Damage**: Damage can punch through and hit opposite facing armor

### Step 4: Performance Degradation
- **Engine HP Loss**: Reduce max speed by % HP lost
- **Sensor HP Loss**: Reduce sensitivity and range by % HP lost  
- **Life Support HP Loss**: GAME OVER at 0% HP remaining
- **Navigation HP Loss**: Reduce pitch/yaw rate, increase turn radius by % HP lost
- **Weapons HP Loss**: Reduce reload speed, disable weapon types by % HP lost

## OOBLECK ARMOR MECHANICS
### Automatic Redistribution
- **Rate**: 1% of starting armor HP per second per facing
- **Direction**: Always flows from high HP facings to low HP facings
- **Limitation**: Only affects oobleck layer, not meta-material layer
- **Visual**: Armor readout shows real-time redistribution

### Emergency Redistribution (Double-tap Keys)
- **Activation**: Double-tap keys 1-6 within 300ms
- **Effect**: Doubles oobleck armor HP on target facing
- **Cost**: Extra HP removed evenly from 4 adjacent facings  
- **Cooldown**: 5 second cooldown per facing
- **Risk**: Weakens other facings significantly

### Adjacent Facing Rules
- **FORE**: Adjacent to PORT, STARBOARD, TOP, BOTTOM
- **AFT**: Adjacent to PORT, STARBOARD, TOP, BOTTOM  
- **PORT**: Adjacent to FORE, AFT, TOP, BOTTOM
- **STARBOARD**: Adjacent to FORE, AFT, TOP, BOTTOM
- **TOP**: Adjacent to FORE, AFT, PORT, STARBOARD
- **BOTTOM**: Adjacent to FORE, AFT, PORT, STARBOARD

## HITBOX SYSTEM MAPPING
### Internal System Locations
- **FORE hits**: Navigation (60%), Sensors (40%), Hull (cascade)
- **AFT hits**: Engines (70%), Life Support (30%), Hull (cascade)
- **PORT/STARBOARD hits**: Weapons (50%), Navigation (30%), Engines (20%), Hull (cascade)
- **TOP hits**: Sensors (50%), Life Support (30%), Navigation (20%), Hull (cascade)
- **BOTTOM hits**: Engines (40%), Weapons (40%), Life Support (20%), Hull (cascade)

### Hull System (Internal)
- **Hull HP**: Acts as internal system, can be hit from any direction
- **PEN Threshold**: 10% of starting HP (very low - structural weakness)
- **Damage Sources**: Drag turns, penetrating weapon hits, cascade damage
- **Critical Failure**: Instant implosion at 0 HP (GAME OVER)
- **No Performance Impact**: Hull damage has no effect until catastrophic failure

## DAMAGE VISUALIZATION
- **Armor Readout**: 6 facing bars showing oobleck/meta-material layers
- **System Status**: Individual HP bars for each internal system
- **Damage Indicators**: Visual effects on damaged facings
- **Critical Warnings**: Alerts when systems approach failure
- **Redistribution Display**: Real-time oobleck flow visualization

## TACTICAL IMPLICATIONS
### Armor Angling
- **Optimal Angles**: Present strongest facings toward threats
- **Emergency Positioning**: Use emergency redistribution before taking fire
- **Damage Control**: Manual redistribution to maintain combat effectiveness

### System Priority
- **Life Support**: Critical - game over if lost
- **Engines**: High priority - mobility is survival
- **Navigation**: Medium priority - affects maneuverability  
- **Weapons**: Medium priority - affects offensive capability
- **Sensors**: Low priority - can fight partially blind

                              FUTURE DEVELOPMENT CONCEPTS
================================================================================

## ICE SHEET SURFACE ENVIRONMENT (Future Implementation)
Description: Replace simple surface boundary with dramatic ice mass
- Solid Ice Sheet: Surface becomes solid sheet of sea ice instead of arbitrary ceiling
- Jagged Ice Structures: Dramatic ice formations descending from surface
- Vertical Terrain: Ice creates overhead terrain like inverted mountains
- Cat and Mouse Gameplay: Hide-and-seek in surface ice formations
- Dual Environment: Combat occurs both at sea floor AND in surface ice mass
- 3D Complexity: Ice provides vertical cover and navigation challenges
- Tactical Depth: Surface becomes dangerous but potentially advantageous terrain

## DEPTH SYSTEM CLARIFICATION
Current Implementation:
- y=300: Surface level (depth 0 meters) - submarines can reach this
- y=0: 300 meters depth 
- y=-200: 500 meters depth (typical crush depth)
- y=-300: 600 meters depth (emergency depth)

Depth Formula: Actual_Depth = 300 - y_position
- Higher y values = shallower depth
- Lower y values = deeper depth  
- No surface restrictions = tactical choice to expose at surface

## SURFACE TACTICS
Risk/Reward of Surfacing (depth 0):
- RISKS: Maximum exposure, highest sonar signature, vulnerable to detection
- REWARDS: Maximum speed potential, best sensor range, emergency escape route
- TACTICAL: High-risk maneuver for specific situations
