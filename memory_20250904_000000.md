- Dual torpedo types with realistic physics
- Six homing modes operational
- Weapons HUD and combat controls working
- Enemy submarines updated for high-speed engagement
- All core mechanics verified functional

## Available Next Steps
1. **Mission System** - Objectives, scoring, progression
2. **Advanced AI** - Coordinated enemy attacks, formations  
3. **Environmental Effects** - Combat in different conditions
4. **Sound System** - Combat audio and effects
5. **UI Improvements** - Enhanced tactical displays
6. **Testing/Refinement** - Polish existing systems

## Session Status  
**Progress: 95%** - Elite Submarine Fighter Transformation NEARLY COMPLETE

## Major Changes
✅ **Removed Mouse-Based Maneuver System**: Eliminated complex mouse reticle control
✅ **Implemented Direct Keyboard Control**: Classic submarine controls
   - W/S: Forward/Reverse thrust with momentum
   - A/D: Direct yaw (turn left/right)  
   - Arrow Up/Down: Direct pitch control (climb/dive)
   - Q/E: Direct roll control with auto-leveling
✅ **Mouse Reserved for Camera**: Mouse now controls camera around submarine
✅ **Fixed Firing Reticle**: Simplified positioning, always faces camera

## Technical Changes Made
1. **Control System Overhaul** - submarine.js:20-30, 208-280, 360-421
   - Replaced mouse-based maneuver system with direct keyboard controls
   - Added updateDirectControl() method for immediate submarine response
   - Removed complex reticle following and target orientation systems
   - Simplified controls: thrust, yaw, pitch, roll all directly keyboard-driven

2. **Firing Reticle Simplified** - submarine.js:423-469
   - Streamlined updateFiringReticle() method 
   - Maintains position ahead of submarine, faces camera
   - Preserves target lock and color systems

3. **Camera Integration** - game.js:512-548
   - Added handleCameraMouseMove() for mouse-look around submarine
   - Mouse controls camera rotation while in follow mode
   - Maintains existing free camera mode with 'C' key toggle

4. **UI Updates** - index.html:60-63
   - Updated control instructions for new keyboard scheme
   - Clarified W/S Forward/Reverse, A/D Turn, Arrows Pitch, Q/E Roll

## Current Progress
**✅ Elite Fighter Submarine Models Created:**
- Tornado Class: Fast interceptor with dual engines and sleek profile
- Lightning Class: Needle-like attack fighter with single central engine  
- Typhoon Class: Heavy fighter with large wings and triple engines
- Hurricane Class: Balanced fighter-bomber with swept wings and dual engines
- Tempest Class: Command fighter with delta wings, bridge, and quad engines

**✅ Advanced Flight Mechanics:**
- Speed-dependent turning: Turn rate decreases with velocity
- Drag turn system: Double-tap A/D for 30% extra turn rate with damage risk
- Elite-style controls: W/S pitch, A/D yaw, Q/E depth, mouse wheel throttle

**🔄 Weapon Systems (In Progress):**
- Defined 8 new weapon types: HiVeloc Rockets, Heavy/Light/Interceptor Torpedoes, Light/Medium/Heavy Cannons, Point Defense
- Each weapon has unique characteristics: lock times, damage, range, ammo count

## Server Status
- Game server running on localhost:8030
- Ready for testing new submarine fighter mechanics
