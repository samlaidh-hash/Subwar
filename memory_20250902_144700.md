# Sub War 2060 - Session Memory
**Date:** 2025-09-02  
**Session:** Comprehensive Testing of Submarine Movement System

## Current State
- Submarine movement system fully implemented in submarine.js
- Game structure with modular JS files (game.js, submarine.js, ocean.js, enemies.js, weapons.js)
- HUD system integrated with submarine stats
- Camera following system implemented
- Complete submarine visual design with hull, tower, periscope, propeller, and navigation lights

## Session Objective
Perform comprehensive testing of Sub War 2060 submarine movement system:
1. Server startup and game loading verification
2. All movement controls testing (W/S, A/D, Q/E, Arrow keys)
3. HUD updates verification (depth, speed, hull health)
4. Camera following mechanics testing
5. Visual design verification
6. Physics and control responsiveness testing

## Progress: 100%

## Testing Plan
1. [✅] Start localhost:8000 server
2. [✅] Verify game loads with submarine visible
3. [✅] Test forward/backward movement (W/S, Arrow Up/Down)
4. [✅] Test turning controls (A/D, Arrow Left/Right)  
5. [✅] Test depth controls (Q/E for surface/dive)
6. [✅] Verify HUD updates correctly
7. [✅] Test camera following mechanics
8. [✅] Verify submarine visual design elements
9. [✅] Test control responsiveness and physics
10. [✅] Document findings and issues
