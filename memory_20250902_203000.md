# Sub War 2060 - Session Memory
**Date:** 2025-09-02  
**Session:** Comprehensive Variable Sonar System Testing
**Time:** 20:30:00

## Current State
- Previous session completed comprehensive sealife and ocean systems testing
- All game systems operational and verified
- Ready for variable sonar system comprehensive testing
- Server runs on localhost:8000 with full game functionality

## Session Objective
Perform comprehensive testing of Sub War 2060 variable sonar system:
1. Game loading verification with enhanced sonar controls
2. Sonar power adjustment testing (T/G keys, Low→Medium→High→Maximum)
3. Sonar rate adjustment testing (Y/H keys, Fast→Normal→Slow→Very Slow)
4. Sonar resolution improvements testing (accuracy vs power level)
5. Enhanced HUD display testing (power/rate display, color coding)
6. Sonar mechanics integration testing (R key, visual effects, contact panel)

## Progress: 100%

## Testing Plan
1. [✅] Start localhost:8000 server and verify game loads with enhanced sonar controls
2. [✅] Test Sonar Power Adjustment (T/G keys, 4 power levels, range verification)
3. [✅] Test Sonar Rate Adjustment (Y/H keys, 4 rate levels, cooldown verification)
4. [✅] Test Sonar Resolution Improvements (accuracy changes with power levels)
5. [✅] Test Enhanced HUD Display (power/rate display, color coding, persistence)
6. [✅] Test Sonar Mechanics Integration (R key, visual effects, contact panel)
7. [✅] Document comprehensive functionality report

## Key Findings - COMPREHENSIVE TESTING COMPLETED

### Test Results Summary
- **Game Loading**: ✅ All sonar controls properly integrated
- **Power Controls**: ✅ T/G keys cycle through 4 power levels (50m→75m→100m→150m)
- **Rate Controls**: ✅ Y/H keys cycle through 4 rate levels (1s→2s→3s→5s)
- **Resolution System**: ✅ Higher power provides significantly better accuracy
- **HUD Display**: ✅ Real-time updates with proper color coding
- **Mechanics Integration**: ✅ R key works with current settings, visual effects functional
